            <p>The little budgie bird is one of the most popular pets in the world, ranking just behind dogs and cats, and it's no wonder. This affectionate, cute bird is small and inexpensive, and if trained properly a budgie can mimic human speech. The origin of its formal name―budgerigar―is a mystery, but by any name, this little bird is a charming companion for most pet owners.

            <p>Some people refer to budgies by their full name (budgerigars), and some call them parakeets.  But while budgies are parakeets, there are many different types of parakeets, and they come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. </p>

            <p>They're not the smallest parrots―that distinction belongs to the parrotlet―but budgies are quite tiny. Most budgies in captivity average between 7 or 8 inches from the beak to the tip of the tail. Wild budgies in their native habitat of Australia are even smaller.</p>
